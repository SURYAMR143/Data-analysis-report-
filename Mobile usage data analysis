  - 45% Female users

 App Usage Patterns

 Screen Time Analysis

1. Average daily screen time varies significantly by age group and gender

2. Male users generally show higher screen time across most age groups

3. Peak usage observed in middle age groups (around 30-35 years)

Age Group Distribution

Key Insights

1. User Engagement Tiers

   - Clear segmentation into five distinct behavioural classes

3. Growth Opportunities

   - Investigate potential barriers to entry for users outside the core age groups

   - Consider features to attract users in underrepresented age segments

Areas for Further Investigation

1. Correlation between platform choice and engagement levels

2. Factors driving the gender gap in certain age groups

3. Retention rates across different behavioural classes

4. Impact of age on platform preference
